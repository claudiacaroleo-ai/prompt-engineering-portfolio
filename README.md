# Prompt Engineering Portfolio

**Evaluation · Iteration · Documentation**

This repository documents my work in **prompt engineering** with a strong emphasis on **evaluation methodologies, iterative design, and rigorous documentation**.

It is not a collection of isolated prompts, but a structured, evolving body of work that reflects a **systematic approach to guiding large language models** toward reliable, controllable, and high-quality outputs.

The repository treats prompt engineering as a **governance and evaluation discipline**: prompts are designed, tested, compared, and reasoned about as first-class artifacts, not as creative inputs or one-off tricks.

My background combines:
- Senior experience in strategy, communication, and content design
- A master's degree in data analytics
- Ongoing specialization in generative AI, LLMs, and AI agents
- A strong interest in **AI education and teaching**

## Repository Purpose
# Where to start

If you are reviewing this repository for the first time, start here:

- case-studies/luxury-brand-voice-governance  
  A full, production-shaped case study on tone control, evaluation criteria, iterative prompt refinement, and **LLM output governance** in a high-risk brand context.

- case-studies/sentiment-eval-prompt-strategies  
  A structured comparison of prompt strategies using explicit sampling, evaluation protocols, and failure-aware analysis.

- docs/prompt-evaluation-framework.md  
  The evaluation principles and criteria that guide all case studies in this repository.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **hands-on, production-oriented prompt engineering**, focusing on:
- How prompts are **designed**
- How they are **tested and compared**
- How failures are **analyzed**
- How insights are **generalized into reusable patterns**

This repository is intentionally **method-driven**, not tool-driven.

## How to read this repository
This repository is designed to support different levels of review:

- **Quick scan (5 minutes)**  
  Read the repository purpose, current focus areas, and one full case study.

- **Technical review (15–30 minutes)**  
  Focus on the luxury brand voice case study, evaluation criteria, and experimental extensions.

- **Deep dive / teaching use**  
  Explore raw experiment outputs, documented failures, and reasoning sections inside case studies.

All materials are intentionally documented to make design decisions, trade-offs, and limitations explicit.

## Methodological Principles
Across all projects, I apply a consistent and explicit methodology focused on evaluation, iteration, and output governance.


### Explicit Objectives
Each prompt is designed with a clearly defined target behavior before experimentation begins (e.g., tone, factual accuracy, structure, constraints).

### Iteration Over Intuition
Prompts are refined through controlled iteration and comparison, not through intuition or trial-and-error alone.

### Evaluation Before Optimization
Outputs are assessed using qualitative and quantitative criteria before any optimization or scaling is attempted.

### Documentation of Failures
Unsuccessful prompts are intentionally preserved and analyzed to understand failure modes, edge cases, and model limitations.

### Transferability
Prompt patterns are designed to be reusable across domains and contexts, avoiding one-off solutions.

## Current Focus Areas

Current work in this repository focuses on:
- Prompt evaluation and structured comparison
- Reduction of hallucinations and output inconsistency
- Clarity, tone control, and instruction-following
- Early exploration of prompt versioning and governance
- Foundations for prompt assessment in educational contexts

---

## Planned Extensions

Planned future work includes:
- Structured benchmarking frameworks
- Statistical analysis of prompt performance
- Teaching-oriented prompt frameworks and exercises

---

## Positioning and intent

This repository reflects a senior-level, method-driven approach to prompt engineering, with a strong focus on evaluation, accountability, and transferability.

The work is intended for applied AI roles, AI governance and quality assurance, and educational or teaching contexts where LLM outputs have real-world impact.
