sephora_0001;love this brand- just not this product. it feels greasy on the skin & broke me out. also separates with makeup. try the every single face or glow screen!!! so much better :);negative;negative;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
sephora_0002;No noticeable difference and isn’t very moisturizing so I need to use a second moisturizer over top of it.;negative;negative;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
sephora_0003;I wanted to like this but unfortunately, something in this product doesn’t work for me. It dried out the skin around my eyes to the point where the areas got red and flaky. I saw someone say that they use it to treat acne scars so I’ve been using this on scars on my arms and legs and I think it’s actually making a difference! Obviously won’t be repurchasing, but glad I could find a way to repurpose the rest of this expensive cream.;negative;negative;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
sephora_0004;Ever since I’ve started using this, I’ve had no blackheads whatsoever. I couldn’t be happier and it is now is staple in my skin care routine. I highly recommend this product.;positive;positive;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
sephora_0005;This is the best lip mask I have found, much better than Laneige. I love how it has no taste and smell and I wake up with soft buttery lips. I have chronic chapped lips so this is a game changer for me.;positive;positive;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
sephora_0006;they only give you half a bottle for each product. they even put colored bottles bottles to make you think there’s more serum, when it’s a half filled bag inside a colored glass jar. look at my pics if you don’t believe;positive;negative;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;ERROR corrected – implicit dissatisfaction
sephora_0007;This product is so worth it! Over the past few weeks my dark circles are lighter and it is very hydrating. 100% recommend;positive;positive;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
sephora_0008;So this sunscreens benefit is hyaluronic acid to retain moisture for 12 hours which in my opinion is the ONLY benefit. It did also absorb easily but I have an oily skin type so when I did try this, I did break out the next day although it does state noncomedogenic. It also states it has no “oxybenzone“ but it has 10% of Homosalate in it still which is very simular to Oxybenzone making it a toxic chemical.. there are statements proving you shouldn’t use this chemical in any sun or skincare. As well as avobenzone these are hormonal disruptors. The ingredients that are also added are BHT + trisodium EDTA which are also carcinogens. So no thank you eeeek.;negative;negative;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
sephora_0009;Absolutely LOVE IT!! It is my must-have for the upcoming spring and summer. After the first use my pores look minimized. WOW!!! I use this cream in a combo with Santorini grape oil, hey its still winter-my skin needs extra hydration. Before buying it this product I was reading the comments and feedbacks. The negative comments and dislikes were only from the girls with dry skin type. DEAR GIRLS! Know your skin type and Read very carefully info about the product you want to try. It’s not about to have all the best skin care products, its about to have the products which are suitable and best for your skin type. Wish everyone look beautiful, gorgeous and best you can!!!;positive;positive;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
sephora_0010;I am a fan of Fresh skincare products and I was delighted to receive this product complimentary from Fresh. First, this smells wonderful. It has kept my skin hydrated all day and it made my skin feel soft and glowing. It’s a really wonderful product.;positive;positive;few_shot_few_shot_failure_aware;ChatGPT;
