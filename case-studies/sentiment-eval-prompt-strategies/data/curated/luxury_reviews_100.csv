sephora_0001,P454380,love this brand- just not this product. it feels greasy on the skin & broke me out. also separates with makeup. try the every single face or glow screen!!! so much better :),2,negative,sephora_kaggle,en,Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++
sephora_0002,P443840,No noticeable difference and isn’t very moisturizing so I need to use a second moisturizer over top of it.,2,negative,sephora_kaggle,en,Caffeine Eye Cream
sephora_0003,P429515,"I wanted to like this but unfortunately, something in this product doesn’t work for me. It dried out the skin around my eyes to the point where the areas got red and flaky. I saw someone say that they use it to treat acne scars so I’ve been using this on scars on my arms and legs and I think it’s actually making a difference! Obviously won’t be repurchasing, but glad I could find a way to repurpose the rest of this expensive cream.",2,negative,sephora_kaggle,en,C-Tango Vitamin C Eye Cream

sephora_0005,P475908,"This is the best lip mask I have found, much better than Laneige. I love how it has no taste and smell and I wake up with soft buttery lips. I have chronic chapped lips so this is a game changer for me.",5,positive,sephora_kaggle,en,Aqua Bomb Overnight Lip Mask
sephora_0006,P402718,"they only give you half a bottle for each product. they even put colored bottles bottles to make you think there’s more serum, when it’s a half filled bag inside a colored glass jar. look at my pics if you don’t believe",5,positive,sephora_kaggle,en,Power Couple Advanced Retinol and Lactic Acid Duo

sephora_0008,P482742,"So this sunscreens benefit is hyaluronic acid to retain moisture for 12 hours which in my opinion is the ONLY benefit. It did also absorb easily but I have an oily skin type so when I did try this, I did break out the next day although it does state noncomedogenic. It also states it has no “oxybenzone“ but it has 10% of Homosalate in it still which is very simular to Oxybenzone making it a toxic chemical.. there are statements proving you shouldn’t use this chemical in any sun or skincare. As well as avobenzone these are hormonal disruptors. The ingredients that are also added are BHT + trisodium EDTA which are also carcinogens. So no thank you eeeek.",2,negative,sephora_kaggle,en,Urban Environment Fresh-Moisture Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 42

I use this cream in a combo with Santorini grape oil, hey its still winter-my skin needs extra hydration. Before buying it this product I was reading the comments and feedbacks. The negative comments and dislikes were only from the girls with dry skin type. DEAR GIRLS! Know your skin type and Read very carefully info about the product you want to try.

sephora_0011,P278317,"My coworker recommended these to me and said they changed her life. She and I both have super duper sensitive skin, and lots of toners and exfoliators break us out into both rashes and acne. I decided to just take the plunge and buy it, and it did not disappoint. I have been an Ordinary glycolic acid girly for almost two years, but these pads have replaced it. You can also cut them in half and only use one half a day because they have enough product in them, and they can last you even longer!

sephora_0022,P415771,"After all the amazing reviews I’ve seen on this product I decided to splurge and try it. Well, I’m not exactly sure what everyone is seeing that makes it so amazing because personally I feel like it’s just water. I’ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and I’ve noticed nothing.

sephora_0026,P421235,"I am 40 and finding the right products to help with the aging process is vital! And this Double Serum which I received complimentary from Clarins has now earned its way to a permanent spot in my skincare routine! I use it in my morning routine, first by adjusting the cool pump dial thing to control the amount of product needed. Definitely do not want to waste any! Then I warm it in my hands before patting it into my skin! It is a slightly thicker but still lightweight consistency! And absorbs perfectly! I find the scent to be refreshing and not overwhelming.

sephora_0029,P422536,"I have super oily skin, and live in HOT Texas heat. I’d skip moisturizer altogether if I could, but I have some combination patches that get dry, and moisturizing helps everything else go on smoother. Of all the oil-free this and that I try, I really like this moisturizer because it does on light and dries quickly. So many other “gel“ or supposed water formulas take forever to dry, especially if my bathroom’s hot, steamy and humid after my shower. With this moisturizer, I don’t have to wait nearly so long before it dries and I can put on my makeup. I can’t say that it keeps my face “matte“ during the day.

sephora_0040,P433435,I have been struggling to find a good foundation for oily skin that doesn’t break me out. This has been just amazing. Not a single breakout from it. It isn’t as matte as I hoped it would be and is a little thick. It does feel like it sits on the skin vs melting into the skin. But I will say this is a beautiful foundation.

I wouldn’t recommend using it nightly if you’re new to this product but if you start slowly and alternating with another eye cream you WILL see results.,5,positive,sephora_kaggle,en,5 Stars Retinol + Niacinamide Eye Serum
sephora_0089,P248404,Love this face cleanser. It keeps my sensitive skin feeling soft and smooth without striping it or making it feel tight or stiff and removes makes up and more.

sephora_0091,P433435,"I usually wear a shade or two above the lightest shade in skin products, but after reading the reviews I opted for the lightest color which was a perfect match (sorry, it is not porcelain skin friendly :( ). It looks very nice when first applied though the finish is more of a velvety natural glow than matte. That’s where the positives end. It starts creasing minutes after applying and shifts and streaks throughout the day. It’s worse with the more moisturizing products I use, but it still happens even if I apply it to totally dry skin. By the end of the day, it has worn off almost completely, even after applying finishing powder and a bit of spray.",2,negative,sephora_kaggle,en,CC+ Cream Oil-Free Matte with SPF 40
sephora_0092,P461537,This Sephora got higher prices than other countries. And some of my friends got 20% off code recently Coz they haven’t been shopping from here for a long time! What a crazy company!,2,negative,sephora_kaggle,en,The Rice Wash Skin-Softening Cleanser
sephora_0093,P378852,"This may not be for medium and darker skin tones. This has pearlescent component which contributes to the “brightening” effect. Albeit temporary, it was just what i was looking for, along with the “energizing” claim. However this shimmer, imo, borders on a highlighter. Esp on my medium skin tone. Also does not blend well upon application and it has a HINT of orange tint, which is noticeable. So, since my skin didn’t absorb it properly, it just made me look like I rubbed a dull highlighter around the eye area. Not for me.",2,negative,sephora_kaggle,en,GinZing Ultra-Hydrating Energy-Boosting Cream

sephora_0095,P429515,"I’ve tried other eye creams because of the price of this one but I just keep coming back.  It’s carried me through 2 pregnancies and now two toddlers with countless late nights.  I can definitely see a difference within a week anytime I’ve been away from it.  It’s an unfortunately expensive staple in my make up bag.  Also despite all the complaints, I love the packaging.  When my cream is done, I pop it open, take out the canister, put it back together and give it to my kids, they love twisting it and playing with them.",5,positive,sephora_kaggle,en,C-Tango Vitamin C Eye Cream

sephora_0097,P269122,"Product works well, but is way over priced.I think there are other skin care products out there that work WAY better and are never this expensive. I recommend looking into Sanitas or Lira Clinical, I have acne and my skin loves retinol. Best thing for acne prone skin would be either of those brands because you actually get the results for the money you put in. Dr Dennis Gross is WAY over priced.",2,negative,sephora_kaggle,en,Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel Pads
sephora_0098,P448937,"I’m on chemotherapy and as a result have incredibly dry and sensitive skin that’s been pretty dull. While this specific product doesn’t combat the dullness (I have a serum for that,) it’s left my skin feeling supple, form, and rebuilt my barrier. I am so in love with this product and can’t recommend it enough. Slight fragrance, but it’s really a pleasant smell in my opinion. Love love love.",5,positive,sephora_kaggle,en,ICE Ceramide Moisturizer with Vitamin F
sephora_0099,P460516,"I do not recommend. I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to scent. It has a mild scent, but it made my eyes sting when removing mascara. It will also need to be part of a double cleanse process as it doesn’t remove makeup entirely.
