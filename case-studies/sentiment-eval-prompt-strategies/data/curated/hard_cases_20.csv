sephora_0052,P443840,Caffeine Eye Cream,5,positive,"I like the texture of this product, it’s not too rich yet the hydration is there. I think it helped with my undereye puffiness. Mine is empty and I see myself buy it again, the price is good and it’s effective!And it’s fragrance free like every product of this brand.","expectation_mismatch,hedging,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0022,P415771,The Essence Skincare Boosting Treatment,2,negative,"After all the amazing reviews I’ve seen on this product I decided to splurge and try it. Well, I’m not exactly sure what everyone is seeing that makes it so amazing because personally I feel like it’s just water. I’ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and I’ve noticed nothing. I feel like this item is the biggest scam of an item. Tatcha is an amazing brand and I love so many of their other products but this one is a total waste of money","long,mixed_sentiment,pos_and_neg"
sephora_0068,P278317,Facial Radiance Pads,2,negative,"I am not a fan of these, I’ll finish out the pack I bought but can’t say I’d buy them again. The pads are quite wet (better than being dry, but definitely wetter than I’d like) and my face feels sticky afterwards, like there’s a slight film left. I only use them while traveling and wouldn’t be able to make myself use them daily.","comparison,irritation_breakout,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0091,P433435,CC+ Cream Oil-Free Matte with SPF 40,2,negative,"I usually wear a shade or two above the lightest shade in skin products, but after reading the reviews I opted for the lightest color which was a perfect match (sorry, it is not porcelain skin friendly :( ). It looks very nice when first applied though the finish is more of a velvety natural glow than matte. That’s where the positives end. It starts creasing minutes after applying and shifts and streaks throughout the day. It’s worse with the more moisturizing products I use, but it still happens even if I apply it to totally dry skin. By the end of the day, it has worn off almost completely, even after applying finishing powder and a bit of spray.","irritation_breakout,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0028,P482320,Mini Glowscreen Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid + Niacinamide,2,negative,"I really wanted to love this product, but the “glow” aspect just looks like a greasy mess. it also has pore clogging ingredients. I love the packaging and the texture, but not worth it","mixed_sentiment,pos_and_neg"
sephora_0029,P422536,Original Skin Matte Moisturizer with Willowherb,5,positive,"I have super oily skin, and live in HOT Texas heat. I’d skip moisturizer altogether if I could, but I have some combination patches that get dry, and moisturizing helps everything else go on smoother. Of all the oil-free this and that I try, I really like this moisturizer because it does on light and dries quickly. So many other “gel“ or supposed water formulas take forever to dry, especially if my bathroom’s hot, steamy and humid after my shower. With this moisturizer, I don’t have to wait nearly so long before it dries and I can put on my makeup. I can’t say that it keeps my face “matte“ during the day. But I use a combination of various products that all combat the oils on my face. This is one of the first steps in that routine.","irritation_breakout,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0090,P434545,Glow Cycle Retin-ALT Power Serum,2,negative,"Looks very cool love the packaging, but burned my skin so bad to the point where I had to wash it off and got little red bumps on my cheek.","mixed_sentiment,pos_and_neg"
sephora_0061,P410400,U.F.O. Salicylic Acid BHA Acne Treatment Face Oil,2,negative,"smells like herbs, but not in a good way - more like  a kitchen. it also broke me out and my skin never cleared up. still used the product because they say it could just be “purging“. nope, just not a good product for me. i think i got i’ll from the scent","hedging,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0067,P482320,Mini Glowscreen Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid + Niacinamide,5,positive,"LOVE this product! It’s such a nice sunscreen that doubles as a highlight! I like putting it where I usually put highlight on underneath my foundation and it really does shine through so naturally. It matches my skin tone fine, but I hope they get more shades in the future for others to also enjoy.*In the photo I have just the highlight on.","long,mild_negative,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0058,P448937,ICE Ceramide Moisturizer with Vitamin F,2,negative,"I got this as a sample while I was walking through Sephora. I tried it. I do NOT like it. After I put it on, my hands have this coating all over them. I had to wash my hands two times to get the film off. Then I realized I have the same film all over my face. I am not at all surprised people are breaking out with this. I expected it to be like a barrier repair product but it just feels like I’m wearing a coating. I received 3 samples, I tried one, and I’ll toss the other two.","expectation_mismatch,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0018,P427406,Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toning Solution,2,negative,"I have been using this product for almost a year and it was working really well at calming my redness. Yet, I started recently noticing that my face would feel itchy every time I would apply it. The next day, half of my face had little dry patches so I tossed it.(I have acne scars and sensitive/combo skin)","irritation_breakout,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0069,P422905,Moisturizing Eye Bomb with Squalane,2,negative,"Wanted to love it based off of all the great reviews but unfortunately this product gave me milia. I have dry skin and I’m a little on the sensitive side, this felt smooth and is also a great base for makeup. Used it for 2 weeks night and day but I didn’t see any significant changes.","irritation_breakout,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0065,P500777,Sugar Lip Balm Hydrating Treatment,2,negative,"I was beyond thrilled to see my long lost favorite color, Plum, had returned. I have bought many tubes of this product over the years in multiple colors. However, I was quickly disappointed when I realized that the formula has totally changed. As other reviews have also said, the new formula is not moisturizing at all - it actually makes my lips drier. The color is lovely but I’ll be returning. Wish I had read the reviews first…","implicit_dissatisfaction,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0013,P248404,Pure Skin Face Cleanser,2,negative,"It’s okay but it’s definitely not great. Won’t help acne at all if that is something you deal with. Quite drying on the skin and leaves it feeling tight. It also has a weird, bar soap residue that’s hard to remove with just water. There’s better drugstore face washes out there. Save your money on this one.","long,mild_negative,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0095,P429515,C-Tango Vitamin C Eye Cream,5,positive,"I’ve tried other eye creams because of the price of this one but I just keep coming back.  It’s carried me through 2 pregnancies and now two toddlers with countless late nights.  I can definitely see a difference within a week anytime I’ve been away from it.  It’s an unfortunately expensive staple in my make up bag.  Also despite all the complaints, I love the packaging.  When my cream is done, I pop it open, take out the canister, put it back together and give it to my kids, they love twisting it and playing with them.","expectation_mismatch,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0040,P433435,CC+ Cream Oil-Free Matte with SPF 40,5,positive,I have been struggling to find a good foundation for oily skin that doesn’t break me out. This has been just amazing. Not a single breakout from it. It isn’t as matte as I hoped it would be and is a little thick. It does feel like it sits on the skin vs melting into the skin. But I will say this is a beautiful foundation. My skin looks beautiful with it. Great coverage too.,"irritation_breakout,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0097,P269122,Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel Pads,2,negative,"Product works well, but is way over priced.I think there are other skin care products out there that work WAY better and are never this expensive. I recommend looking into Sanitas or Lira Clinical, I have acne and my skin loves retinol. Best thing for acne prone skin would be either of those brands because you actually get the results for the money you put in. Dr Dennis Gross is WAY over priced.","hedging,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0098,P448937,ICE Ceramide Moisturizer with Vitamin F,5,positive,"I’m on chemotherapy and as a result have incredibly dry and sensitive skin that’s been pretty dull. While this specific product doesn’t combat the dullness (I have a serum for that,) it’s left my skin feeling supple, form, and rebuilt my barrier. I am so in love with this product and can’t recommend it enough. Slight fragrance, but it’s really a pleasant smell in my opinion. Love love love.","irritation_breakout,long,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0037,P433435,CC+ Cream Oil-Free Matte with SPF 40,2,negative,Unfortunately this clung to my dry patches and made my makeup seem uneven. Almost full coverage for a CC cream but the transfer on this is impossible to control. I’ve used different types of setting powder on top but it seems to always transfer,"irritation_breakout,mixed_sentiment"
sephora_0035,P297516,Checks and Balances Frothy Face Wash,2,negative,"I’m super oily. Not combination. OILY. And this is a hard pass. I love the way it feels on my skin while using it, but after my skin is even halfway dried, it feels tight and overly dry. This is dehydrating and is just absolutely not for me.","irritation_breakout,mixed_sentiment"
