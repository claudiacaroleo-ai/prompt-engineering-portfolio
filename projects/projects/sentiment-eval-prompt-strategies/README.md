# Sentiment eval prompt strategies

Goal: evaluate prompt strategies for binary sentiment classification (positive/negative) on real luxury beauty reviews.

This project focuses on:
- prompt strategy comparison (baseline vs few-shot vs domain-aware)
- quantitative metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- error taxonomy and failure-mode analysis
- cost–performance trade-offs (tokens vs accuracy)
