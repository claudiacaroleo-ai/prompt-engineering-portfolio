# Experiment design

This document describes the initial prompt comparison experiment.

## Goal
Compare two different prompts for the same task and evaluate differences in output quality.

## Task
Summarization (Italian news article).

## Prompts
- Prompt A: generic instruction to summarize the text.
- Prompt B: structured instruction with constraints (length, tone, key points).

## Input
The same Italian news article is used for both prompts.

## Evaluation method
Responses are evaluated using the criteria defined in `evaluation.md`.

## Expected observations
- Differences in structure and clarity
- Potential trade-offs between brevity and completeness
