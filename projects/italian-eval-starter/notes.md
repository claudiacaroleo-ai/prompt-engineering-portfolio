# Notes

This file tracks decisions, open questions, and early observations.

## Why this project
I want to understand how prompt evaluation changes when working in Italian, compared to English-focused benchmarks.

## Open questions
- What makes a “good” Italian response harder to evaluate automatically?
- Which tasks are more sensitive to prompt wording?
