## Evaluation criteria

The baseline output is evaluated using the following qualitative criteria:

- Tone alignment with luxury brand expectations
- Linguistic precision and restraint
- Absence of generic or clichéd expressions
- Consistency of narrative voice
- Instruction adherence

## Comparative notes: baseline vs iteration 01

Compared to the baseline, this iteration shows:
- reduced use of generic luxury language
- improved tonal restraint
- more consistent narrative voice

However, some ambiguity remains due to the lack of
explicit positive guidance and structural constraints.

## Comparative notes: iteration 01 vs iteration 02

Compared to iteration 01, this version shows:
- clearer stylistic direction
- improved sentence-level consistency
- reduced ambiguity in tone interpretation

The introduction of a minimal narrative structure
significantly improves output predictability without over-constraining creativity.

## Observations on few-shot prompting

The few-shot approach improves stylistic clarity and consistency.
However, it also introduces the risk of stylistic convergence
toward the provided examples.

This highlights the trade-off between guidance and originality,
which must be managed carefully in brand-sensitive contexts.
