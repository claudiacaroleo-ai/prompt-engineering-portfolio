- Tone alignment with luxury brand expectations
- Linguistic precision and restraint
- Absence of generic or clichéd expressions
- Consistency of narrative voice
- Instruction adherence

## Comparative notes: baseline vs iteration 01

- reduced use of generic luxury language
- improved tonal restraint
- more consistent narrative voice

However, some ambiguity remains due to the lack of
explicit positive guidance and structural constraints.
