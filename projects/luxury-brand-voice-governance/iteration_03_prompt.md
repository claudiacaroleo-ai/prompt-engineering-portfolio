## Iteration 03 prompt

Below are examples of short promotional texts that reflect
an understated luxury brand voice.

Example 1:
"Our work is defined by precision, patience, and respect for materials.
Every detail exists for a reason, shaped over time rather than trend."

Example 2:
"True refinement is never rushed.
It emerges quietly through craftsmanship, consistency, and intent."

Now write a short promotional text for a luxury brand
that follows the same tone and level of restraint.

Guidelines:
- calm, confident, and precise language
- no emotional exaggeration
- no marketing buzzwords
- subtle sense of exclusivity
